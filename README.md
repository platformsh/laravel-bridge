# Laravel bridge for Platform.sh

This simple bridge library connects a Laravel-based application to [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh/).  In the typical case it should be completely fire-and-forget.

Laravel prefers all configuration to come in through environment variables with specific names in a specific format.  Platform.sh provides configuration information as environment variables in a different specific format.  This library handles mapping the Platform.sh variables to the format Laravel expects for common values.

## Usage

Simply require this package using Composer.  When Composer's autoload is included this library will be activated and the environment variables set.  As long as that happens before Laravel bootstraps its configuration (which it almost certainly will) everything should work fine with no further user-interaction necessary.

```
composer require platformsh/laravel-bridge
```

## Mappings performed

* If a Platform.sh relationship named `database` is defined, it will be taken as an SQL database and mapped to the `DB_*` environment variables for Laravel.

* If a Platform.sh relationship named `rediscache` is defined, it will be mapped to the `REDIS_*` environment variables for Laravel.  Additionally, the `CACHE_DRIVER` variable will be set to `redis` to activate it automatically.

* If a Platform.sh relationship named `redissession` is defined, the `SESSION_DRIVER` will be set to `redis` and the `REDIS_*` variables set based on that relationship. NOTE: This means you _*must*_ set 2 relationships to the same Redis service and endpoint, as Laravel reuses the same backend connection.

* The Laravel `APP_KEY` is set based on the `PLATFORM_PROJECT_ENTROPY` variable, which is provided for exactly this purpose.

* The Laravel `APP_URL` variable is set based on the current route if possible.

* The `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE` variable is set to true if it's not already defined.  A Platform.sh environment is by default encrypted-always, so there's no reason to allow unencrypted cookies.  This can be overridden by setting the Platform.sh variable `env:SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE` to 0.

## Common environment variables not set

Laravel provides reasonable defaults for many environment variables already and this library does not override those.  They may, however, be customized by setting a Platform.sh variable named `env:ENV_NAME`. (Note the `env:` prefix.)  The most likely variables to override are listed below for convenience:

* `env:APP_NAME`: The human-friendly name of the application.
* `env:APP_ENV`: Whether the application is in `production` or `development` mode.
* `env:APP_DEBUG`: Set true to enable verbose error messages.
* `env:APP_KEY`: Set using locally `php artisan key:generate --show` then using that key as the value.
